# TrashTalk
How many times have you been walking around the city and seen trash on the ground, sometimes just centimetres away from a trash can? It can be very frustrating to see people who either have no regard for littering, or just have horrible aim. This is what inspired us to create TrashTalk: trash talk for your trash shots.
